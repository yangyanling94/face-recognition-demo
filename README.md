# face-recognition-demo
This is a Machine Learning project on face recognition using eigenface.


Eigenface is a pattern recognition task where relevant features of the face are used to identify a face.
These features may be related to our notion of objects such as eyes,nose,ear,mouth etc.
In my project, I uses the Eigenface approach which belongs to the template matching family of face recognition techniques.
